# Single_Sigma_GB_recognition

This project provides a Python function to determine if a given rotation axis and misorientation angle correspond to a Σ (Sigma) boundary in either FCC or BCC crystal structures, considering a deviation threshold.

## Features

- Identify Σ boundaries for FCC and BCC crystal structures.
- Consider a deviation threshold to account for measurement inaccuracies.
- Normalize the input rotation axis for accurate comparison.
- Provide detailed results including the corresponding Σ value and actual deviation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## Installation

To install the required packages, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
